Loading the dataset into Power BI
Open Power BI, then click "Get Data." From that option, select Excel Workbook to load the data into the workspace.
 


Data Cleaning and transforming
The dataset loaded is not clean and complete and needs to be prepared for visualization. We cleaned and transformed the data using techniques like replacing null values, filled up and down, removing duplicates, standardizing of date and time, changing types, replacing errors, renaming columns, replacing values, and sorting rows.
 


Visual Elements
The visual elements used are;
Column Chart, Filled Maps, Pie chart, tree map, Line chart, funnel chart, tables, slices, and cards.

The Design Principles
The design principles we used are;
Trustworthy: The data is correct and clean, with labeled axes.
Elegant: The charts are aligned neatly and have a clean and clear layout.
Accessible: Our visualization has readable fonts with slicers added to it. It also has legends.
Here is our interactive report with all the visual elements included in it;
 
 
When we visualized the data for Mali, we found out that it has a total sum of 0.05 and belongs to the low-income group. It is in the region of Sub-Saharan Africa. It was in 2015 that this data was recorded. For the rest of the years, the records and fills are blank as shown below.
 
KEY FINDINGS
From our visualization, we found out that 2018 recorded the highest sum of total of 9.49, followed by 2015 at 6.92. 2010 had the lowest with 0.19.
The ECA region shows substantially high connectivity throughout the year with a sum of total of 10.28. The MENA region has the lowest sum of total of 1.77.
This kind of visualization is very interactive in nature. It also displays realistic data. When we visualized the connectivity for Kenya, we found out that it's for the Sub-Saharan Africa region.
 

The LAC Region recorded the sum of total throughout the year from 2011 to 2019. MENA only recorded the sum of total for three years.
  
The ECA region has a total percentage of 33.43%, holding the highest percentage. The MENA region has 5.75% holding the last in the list.
 
 

So thatâ€™s it for our visualization.
